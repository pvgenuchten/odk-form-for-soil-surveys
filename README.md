# ODK form for Soil Surveys

The repository contains a template form configuration, to turn [ODK Collect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en) into a Field Soil Survey tool.

## Open Data Kit

[ODK](https://getodk.org/) is a framework (mobile app + web tool) to set up tailored field surveys using your mobile app.
With the configuration and manuals from this repository, you will able to set up a Soil Survey field campaign for your organisation.
ODK in combination with this configuration is endorsed by [ISRIC - World Soil Information](https://isric.org) because of:

- Adoption of international standards on Soil Description
- Open Source tool with a vivid community
- Flexibility of customisation

## Manuals

The various [manuals](./docs) describe how to use the tooling for data scientists, field surveyers and administrators.

## Configuration

## Codelists

The repository is also used to maintain a number of [codelists](./codelists), which are derived from [World Reference Base - Fieldguide](https://github.com/iuss-wrb/wrb) and are used in the forms. 

## Contribute

The tool is managed as an Open Source Software project, managed by [ISRIC - World Soil Information](https://isric.org).
